Step 1:
A variable 'sum_of_digits' is declared with 0.

Step 2:

Step 3:
'number' is looped through first after converting the integer into string to seperate the digits.

Step 4:
the digits are added with each other after converting them back into integers and stored in 'sum_of_digits'.

Step 5: 
the 'sum_of_digits' is displayed.
